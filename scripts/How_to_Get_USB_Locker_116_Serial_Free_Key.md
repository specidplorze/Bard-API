Fortunately, there are some ways to get USB Locker 1.1.6 serial free key without paying anything. In this article, we will show you some of the best methods to do so.
 
## Method 1: Use a Keygen or a Serial Key Generator
 
A keygen or a serial key generator is a program that can create valid serial keys for various software applications. You can find many keygens and serial key generators online, especially for old software versions. For example, you can visit KeyGenNinja[^3^], a website that has serial keys and keygens for over 500,000 software products.
 
To use KeyGenNinja, simply type in the name of the software you are looking for in the search box, and click on the result that matches your query. You will see a list of serial keys and keygens for different versions of the software. Look for the one that corresponds to USB Locker 1.1.6, and copy the serial key or download the keygen.
 
Then, install USB Locker on your computer, and enter the serial key when prompted. If you downloaded a keygen, run it and generate a serial key for USB Locker 1.1.6. Then, enter the serial key in the activation window of USB Locker.
 
This method may work for some users, but it also has some drawbacks. First of all, keygens and serial key generators may not always produce valid or working serial keys. Secondly, they may contain viruses or malware that can harm your computer or steal your personal information. Therefore, you should always scan them with an antivirus program before using them. Thirdly, they may violate the copyright laws and terms of service of the software developers. Therefore, you should use them at your own risk and discretion.

## Method 2: Use a Crack or a Patch
 
A crack or a patch is a modified version of the original software executable file that bypasses the activation process or removes the protection features of the software. You can find many cracks and patches online for various software applications, especially for old software versions.
 
To use a crack or a patch, you need to download it from a reliable source, such as Softonic[^1^], which offers free downloads of various software products. Then, you need to replace the original executable file of USB Locker with the cracked or patched version. For example, if you downloaded USB Locker from Softonic[^1^], you will find the executable file in C:\Program Files (x86)\USB Locker\USBLocker.exe. You need to rename or delete this file, and copy the cracked or patched version in its place.
 
Then, run USB Locker as usual, and you should be able to use it without entering any serial key or activation code.
 
This method may also work for some users, but it also has some drawbacks. First of all, cracks and patches may not always work properly or be compatible with your system. Secondly, they may also contain viruses or malware that can harm your computer or steal your personal information. Therefore, you should also scan them with an antivirus program before using them. Thirdly, they may also violate the copyright laws and terms of service of the software developers. Therefore, you should also use them at your own risk and discretion.

## Method 3: Use an Alternative Software
